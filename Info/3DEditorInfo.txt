Editor for editing the scene:

Tabs - Editor, Terrain, Water, Vegitation, Environment, Post Processing, Lighting, Model
Model - Transformation capability, loading capability


Might need an object edit window to edit stuff like camera attributes ...
Need to be able to apply shaders/multiple shaders to a Object/Terrain
Need a basic template texture to apply to all objects and terrain when they are first created
Need to implement water caustics

Editor (undo and redo are last, play button is last)
  *Enter Game Name Label (displays the path and name of the game directory)
  *Create game directory (Opens a window so you can enter a name for the game directory and an create button)
  *Open game directory (Opens a dialog to select the game directory)
  *button to create HUD (Switch to HUD edit mode, Opens window for HUD editing)
  *button to create Menu (Switch to Menu edit mode, Opens window for Menu editing)

NEED 3D MOUSE PICKING AND BETTER DEFINED MATH SYSTEM FOR 3D TERRAIN EDITING (done)
Terrain (Starts out flat with default single texture Below Sea level):
  *Set different attributes of terrain (Tessellation factor for QuadTree ...)
  *Type
    Generate QuadTree
  *Height
    Load heightmap according to the current size
    Generate Perlin Noise and procedural height
  *Size
    Resize Terrain Width and Depth
    Set default Terrain Height
  *Material and Texturing (Can have up to 4 layers of textures)
    Apply a material (Ambient, Diffuse, Specular, Spec Power, etc ...)
    (use a texturemaskSRV that contains 1s and 0s, pick the spot the brush is on that area will contain 1s in the texturemaskSRV and everywhere else will
     have 0s, any spot with a 1 will be updated to the new painted texture. )
    Paint - Allow painting of textures (Done with circle brush applied over vertex area of terrain)
    Apply Normal Map/Bump Map - You choose what normal map to apply
    Generate Shadow Map - Creates a showmap based on the heightmap
    Apply Detail map
    Set Texture Layer Size - Allows user to choose how many texture layers to apply to heightmap
  *Sculpt
    Brush Type: Raise, Lower, Flatten, Smooth
    Raise, Lower and Smooth affect the vertices inside a circle radius brush
    Flatten just levels the terrain to the default terrain height
  *Load Defaults
    Resets the terrain to a default state (Define what a default state is)

Water (Ocean settings and Simple Water settings)
  *Set Parameters for Ocean and simple water
  *Turn on/off reflections
  *Turn on/off refractions
  *Toggle Ocean - Make Ocean Active in other words appear or dissapear
  *Place Simple Water Plane (There can be several different simple water planes in the scene)
    Adjust size of simple water plane
  *Can Select and show/hide a simple water plane
  *Reset Ocean Defaults (Define what a default state is)
  *Reset Simple Water Defaults (Define what a default state is)
  *NEED SOME UNDERWATER ATTRIBUTES BUT UNDERWATER NOT STARTED YET (Need Post Processing Effects for Underwater)

Vegitation (Must have Terrain to apply to)
  *Need to update attributes of vegitation
  *Generate CPU/GPU GrassField - Applied Per node in QuadTree. Applied in a patch size 64x64 for example
  *Load Grass Model
  *Load Tree Model

Post Processing
  *Toggle Post Process Type (Blur, Depth of Field, Bloom, Bokeh, Center of Confution, etc...)
  *Edit Post Process Attributes (Bloom Blur Sigma, Adaption Rate for Luminence, Near/Far Depth Toggle etc...)

Environment
  *Toggle Gravity
  *Toggle camera collision with terrain
  *Set Sea Level water height
  *Toggle Water - Toggles overall water in map. Turn all water on/off
  *Toggle Terrain
  *Toggle Sky Sphere
  *Edit Main Camera Attributes
  *Adjust Camera Speed
  *Toggle Shadow Maps
  *Toggle Sun
  *Toggle Sun Glare - The Lens glare that creates the rings from looking at the sun
  *Set Sun Dir
  *Toggle HDR - High Dynamic Range Lighting (Or is this a Post Process)
  *Toggle Post Processing
  *Indoor - Lets the system know that we are creating an indoor map (Not even close to starting yet)
  *Adjust Time of day if sun is enabled
  *Create Camera - Be able to place a camera into the scene (Orhographic Camera, ...)
  *Create Light - Be able to place a light into the scene (Point, Spotlight, ...)
  *Reset Defaults
  *Set camera back to default position or (0,0,0)

Lighting (Lighting stuff)
  *Add Lights
  *Update Lights
  *Use Deferred Shading
  *Use Radiosity
  *Toggle Radiosity - Not started yet
  *Set Radiosity Attributes - Not started yet

Model
  *Load a volume
  *Transform Item
  *Scale Item
  *Rotate Item
  *Load Models into the scene from a Model File Type (Collada .dae, x mesh, FBX format, OBJ format, .3DS format, .dxf format, etc...)
  *Create Geometry
    Box
    sphere
    ...
